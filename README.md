# React Clicky Game
This application displays a number of country flags that the user can then click on.  The first time each image is clicked on, the user's score is increased by one.  The order of the flags is then shuffled and the user must remember which flags that he/she has already clicked on.  If the user clicks on a duplicate flag, the user loses and the game resets the score back to zero.
