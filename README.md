# React-Clicky-Game
This application is a memory guessing game that renders images to the page that each have click-event listeners assigned to them. The user has a score that is increased for the first time each individual image is clicked.  If the user clicks the same image more than once, the score is reset back to zero.  Every time an image is clicked, the images are re-rendered on the page in a random order.
